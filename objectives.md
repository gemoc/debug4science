Debug4Science aims to propose a disciplined approach to define domain-specific debugging facilities for Domain-Specific Languages within the cotext of scientific computing and numerical analysis. 

The project explores the concept of domain-specific events to be defined as properties over the state of a running model, and raising arbitrarily complex behaviors when a property is activated. Possible behaviors include:
- the definition of breakpoints (i.e. pause the execution), then continuing the execution step-by-step (forward/backward);
- the execution of domain-specific visualizations tools over the current state, its associated history, or the visited execution path; and
- the execution of specific behaviors to trace, log and visualize the rest of the execution.

The project explores the definition of a new meta language to specify domain-specific events over metamodel-based language specification, and proposes an efficient, yet non-intrusive, approach to interpret them at runtime.
